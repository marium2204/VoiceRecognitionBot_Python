# VoiceRecognitionBot_Python
This Python program uses voice commands to perform Google searches. <br>
It leverages speech_recognition for capturing and processing speech, selenium to automate web browsing, and urllib.parse to manage URLs. The program listens through the microphone, converts speech to text, and executes search commands. <br><br>

KEY COMPONENTS: <br>
speech_recognition (sr): Captures and converts speech to text. <br>
selenium: Automates Chrome to perform Google searches based on spoken commands. <br>
urllib.parse: Encodes the search query for URL compatibility. <br><br>

WORKING EXAMPLE: <br>
Input: "Search for Python programming." <br>
Action: Opens Chrome and displays Google search results for "Python programming."<br>
Error Handling: If speech is unclear, an exception prompts the user to retry.<br><br>

USAGE:<br>
Install the required libraries: pip install speechrecognition selenium <br><br>
